The intrusion detection module, that operates detection models (training and detection), the processing modules (store data, apply data processing approaches, etc.), a monitoring and adaptation module, that uses the custom metric and alarm data, to apply the resilience measures, and the interface modules, the API gateway, web application, and the interaction with the cluster through the Kubernetes daemon. The components mainly communicate over HTTP/REST, which provides lightweight, and flexible communication while reinforcing interoperability and independence between components. Some communication channels rely on the publish/subscribe model that provides various relevant guarantees in data transference, such as multiple receivers for a source of information.</p> <p>The implementation of \u00b5Sherlock was mainly conducted using the FastAPI framework with Python. Each service exposes a REST API to allow for communication with other services. The consumers, a Web Application and a command line interface, were developed using Next.JS and Typer, respectively.</p> <p>The tool leverages two message queues using Redis: one to distribute the collected system calls from the cluster and other to deliver it after being processed by the data processing techniques. To collect the system call data from the microservice application being monitored, \u00b5Sherlock uses the Kubernetes Python client to interact with the cluster and deploy a daemonset from a custom \u00b5Sherlock collector. A Kubernetes daemonset ensures that for each operating node there is a pod deployed to collect the system call data using a sysdig probe. The daemonset collects the data and forwards it to the Redis queue.</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Pre-requisites include a kubernetes cluster setup and a microservice application deployed (for example TeaStore).</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jefora/sherlock\ncd sherlock\nHDD=&lt;/volumes/base/dir/&gt; docker-compose up -d --build\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":"<p>Currently, \u00b5Sherlock follows a microservice approach as depicted in the figure below.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#about","title":"About","text":"<p>\u00b5Sherlock was developed in the context of a PhD thesis, carried out within the Software and Systems Engineering (SSE) group of the Centre for Informatics and Systems of the University of Coimbra (CISUC), supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) through the Ph.D. grant 2020.05145.BD.</p> <p>This work is funded by Project \u201cAgenda Mobilizadora Sines Nexus\u201d.
